Data Transformation Pipeline:
-----------------------------
<p>zips.json consists of population distribution data across US zipcodes....pick 5 specific states....find the zipcode that's most populated....calculate the distance of that zipcode from my home (I live in Dallas,TX btw).</p>


NOTE:
----

<p>'DataSet_API_Pipeline.java' makes an assumption that only one specific zipcode will have the highest population. The assumption returns true in my experiment. In read world scenarios, please don't make such assumption and design code safely.</p>

<p><b>Thank You for passing by my third Apache Spark project. More to follow!!!!</b><p>
